Pathname resolution is performed for a process to resolve a pathname to a particular directory entry for a file in the file hierarchy. There may be multiple pathnames that resolve to the same directory entry, and multiple directory entries for the same file. When a process resolves a pathname of an existing directory entry, the entire pathname shall be resolved as described below. When a process resolves a pathname of a directory entry that is to be created immediately after the pathname is resolved, pathname resolution terminates when all components of the path prefix of the last component have been resolved. It is then the responsibility of the process to create the final component.
