In all other cases, the system shall prefix the remaining pathname, 
if any, with the contents of the symbolic link, except that if the contents
 of the symbolic link is the empty string, then either pathname resolution 
 shall fail with functions reporting an [ENOENT] error and utilities writing 
 an equivalent diagnostic message, or the pathname of the directory containing 
 the symbolic link shall be used in place of the contents of the symbolic link. 
 If the contents of the symbolic link consist solely of <slash> characters, then 
 all leading <slash> characters of the remaining pathname shall be omitted from 
 the resulting combined pathname, leaving only the leading <slash> characters from 
 the symbolic link contents. In the cases where prefixing occurs, if the combined 
 length exceeds {PATH_MAX}, and the implementation considers this to be an error,
  pathname resolution shall fail with functions reporting an [ENAMETOOLONG] error 
  and utilities writing an equivalent diagnostic message. Otherwise, the resolved 
  pathname shall be the resolution of the pathname just created. If the resulting 
  pathname does not begin with a <slash>, the predecessor of the first filename of 
  the pathname is taken to be the directory containing the symbolic link.
